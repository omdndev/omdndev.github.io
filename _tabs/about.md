Orhan is an Azure Solution Architect with a solid background in software development. He started working with Azure back in 2012, when the Azure Portal was still written in Silverlight and applications were built with the .NET Framework and deployed using Azure Cloud Services. He’s seen the evolution of Azure up close, loved it, and stayed on board ever since. Nowadays, he helps organizations design cloud solutions and supports teams with their implementation. After all the trial and error along the way, he enjoys sharing the lessons he’s learned with others.
